Reduction from Diophantine equations to provability in IPC2 / System F.

This proof is now integrated into the [Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability) as theorem [H10C_SAT ⪯ SysF_INH](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability/blob/coq-8.13/theories/SystemF/Reductions/H10C_SAT_to_SysF_INH.v).
This provides a constructive many-one reduction from the Halting problem to System F inhabitation as theorem [HaltTM 1 ⪯ SysF_INH](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability/blob/coq-8.13/theories/SystemF/Reductions/HaltTM_1_to_SysF_INH.v).
